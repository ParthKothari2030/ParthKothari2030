# Hi there! 👋

## 🔭 About Me
I am a Master's student in Astronomy at IIT Indore, specializing in astrophysical data analysis, computational modelling, and statistical inference. My research focuses on constraining astrophysics from Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) upper limits and detections in the Post-EoR regime. I employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to explore parameter space for CO and HI models and propose joint likelihood functions to improve constraints on cosmological parameters.

## 💻 Programming Skills
I work with C++, C, and Python, primarily in the context of astrophysical simulations, data analysis, and Bayesian inference. Here’s a breakdown of how I use these languages:

### 🚀 C++/C
- Developing and optimizing simulations for astrophysical models (e.g., LIM simulations).
- Working with large-scale numerical computations and efficient algorithms.
- Handling file I/O operations and integrating C/C++ executables with Python workflows.
- Implementing and modifying numerical solvers for cosmological and astrophysical applications.

### 🐍 Python
- Implementing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms (including Metropolis-Hastings and `emcee`).
- Performing statistical analysis and likelihood estimation for astrophysical data.
- Visualizing power spectra and cosmological parameters.
- Automating workflows by integrating Python with C++/C simulations.
- Conducting research in Bayesian inference, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

## 📂 Projects & Research
- **LIM Simulation & Power Spectrum Analysis**: Simulating Line Intensity Mapping signals and extracting astrophysical information from power spectra.
- **MCMC-Based Parameter Estimation**: Exploring parameter space using MCMC methods to fit astrophysical models.
- **Fluid Mechanics in Astrophysics**: Studying instabilities like Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor in astrophysical fluid dynamics.
- **Bayesian Inference & HMC**: Implementing Bayesian techniques to analyze astrophysical datasets.
